Computer vision focuses on teaching computers to interpret and understand visual data, while machine vision uses computer vision techniques for industrial applications and automation.
Computer vision is concerned with understanding and processing complex, real-world images, while machine vision focuses on capturing and analyzing simpler, controlled images for specific tasks.
Machine vision systems include specialized hardware and software for capturing and processing images, while computer vision relies on general-purpose computers and software.


Machine vision and computer vision are related but distinct:

### **Computer Vision**
- **Focus**: Enabling machines to interpret visual data (images, videos).
- **Applications**: Facial recognition, object detection, medical imaging, autonomous vehicles.
- **Goal**: Replicate human vision for analysis and decision-making.
- **Scope**: Research-oriented, emphasizing algorithms and theory.

### **Machine Vision**
- **Focus**: Practical use of computer vision in industrial settings.
- **Applications**: Quality control, robotic guidance, automated inspection.
- **Goal**: Solve specific tasks like defect detection or part alignment in real-time.
- **Scope**: Application-focused, integrating hardware and software for automation.

### **Key Difference**
- **Computer Vision**: Broad, research-focused, used across many fields.
- **Machine Vision**: Narrow, industry-focused, tailored for real-time industrial tasks.

In short, computer vision is about understanding images, while machine vision applies this understanding to automate industrial processes.
